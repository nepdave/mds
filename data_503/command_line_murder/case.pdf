The clues and the interview are what created the suspect list. The interview confirmed that the suspect was male, not the female from the coffee shop. With this information, we were able to focus on finding a male who is 6ft or taller and a member of the four places in the clues. 



#command 1 and break down

grep -w 'M' people | cut -f1 | grep -Fxf memberships/AAA - | grep -Fxf memberships/Delta_SkyMiles - | grep -Fxf memberships/Terminal_City_Library - | grep -Fxf memberships/Museum_of_Bash_History - > suspect_list.txt



#grabs the ‘M’ single letter from the people file to filter males

grep -w 'M' people | 

#grabs the name column from the people file 

cut -f1 | 
#this one is tricky. -F means string literal, x means exact match for “Joe,” not “Joel,” f means the whole file. The - means take the standard from the pipe. We apply this logic to each membership, then output the suspects to a file.

grep -Fxf memberships/AAA - | 

grep -Fxf memberships/Delta_SkyMiles - | 

grep -Fxf memberships/Terminal_City_Library - | 

grep -Fxf memberships/Museum_of_Bash_History - > suspect_list.txt



Next, we know from the clues to find someone who is 6 ft or taller. This information is available in the vehicles file.



#command 2 and breakdown

grep -B 1 "Height: [6-8]'" vehicles | grep "Owner:" | cut -d: -f2 | sed 's/^ //' | grep -Fxf suspect_list.txt -



#finds anyone between 6-8ft tall

grep -B 1 "Height: [6-8]'" vehicles | 

#just keeps the owner line

grep "Owner:" | 
#just keeps the owner name

cut -d: -f2 | 
#find and replace on white space 

sed 's/^ //' | 
#this one is tricky. -F means string literal, x means exact match for “Joe,” not “Joel,” f means the whole file. The - means take the standard from the pipe. We apply this logic to each membership, then output the suspects to a file. We take the “tall” car owners and filter them through the suspect list.

grep -Fxf suspect_list.txt -



At this point, the suspect list is short, so we can check the names one at a time. I opted to use an environment variable, but putting the names in a list and looping through would be better.
